# What if AI Co-Designed Assessments with Students?

## Amina's Journey Using ChatGPT & Claude 

_Co-agency in Action for TVET Learners in Data Analysis_

> üìå **UNESCO (2023) Guidance:**
> 
> "The use of GenAI in education should be neither imposed in a top-down approach nor driven by commercial hyperbole. Instead, its safe and effective use should be co-designed by teachers and learners."

---

## üéì Meet Amina

Amina is a final-year TVET student in **Data Analysis for Business Intelligence**.

Her teacher offers a challenge:

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Teacher's Challenge:</strong><br>
"Instead of giving you an assessment, let's <strong>design it together</strong> ‚Äî with help from <strong>AI</strong>."
</div>

    --{{0}}--
This represents a fundamental shift from traditional assessment approaches to collaborative, AI-enhanced learning design.

---

## üß≠ Step 1: Understanding Learning Outcomes

Amina is shown 3 key learning outcomes:

- **Analyze real-world datasets**
- **Interpret statistical results**
- **Present findings visually**

<div class="prompt-box">
<strong>Amina's Prompt to Claude:</strong><br>
"Explain these outcomes with examples from the retail sector."
</div>

Claude helps her **understand**, not just memorize.

    --{{0}}--
The first step involves ensuring students truly comprehend what they're expected to achieve, using AI to provide concrete, relevant examples.

---

### üß† Prompt Bank - Step 1

| ‚úÖ High-Competence Prompts | ‚ùå Low-Competence Prompts |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| "Explain these learning outcomes using a retail dataset example." | "Just tell me what these mean simply." |
| "What skills do I need to achieve all these outcomes through a real project?" | "Rewrite outcomes in easy words so I can memorize them." |

> **Quiz Question:** Which approach demonstrates deeper engagement with learning outcomes?
>
> [[ ]] Asking for simple explanations
> [[ ]] Memorizing rewritten outcomes
> [[X]] Connecting outcomes to real-world examples
> [[ ]] Avoiding complex terminology

---

## üí° Step 2: Generating Assessment Ideas

Using **ChatGPT**, Amina explores project possibilities:

<div class="prompt-box">
<strong>Amina's Prompt to ChatGPT:</strong><br>
"Suggest 3 projects to demonstrate all 3 learning outcomes."
</div>

**ChatGPT's Ideas:**

1. **Analyze seasonal sales trends**
2. **Text analysis on customer feedback** ‚≠ê
3. **Logistics dashboard design**

Amina chooses: **Option 2 ‚Äî Sentiment Analysis**

    --{{0}}--
AI helps generate multiple options, allowing students to select projects that align with their interests and career goals.

---

### üß† Prompt Bank - Step 2

| ‚úÖ High-Competence Prompts | ‚ùå Low-Competence Prompts |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| "Suggest 3 projects using customer reviews that meet these learning outcomes." | "Give me an easy topic to score high." |
| "What kinds of businesses benefit from analyzing online reviews?" | "Tell me a project someone already did." |

    --{{0}}--
Notice how high-competence prompts focus on learning and application, while low-competence prompts seek shortcuts or easy grades.

---

## üß± Step 3: Co-Creating the Rubric

Amina collaborates with Claude to design her assessment criteria:

<div class="prompt-box">
<strong>Amina's Prompt to Claude:</strong><br>
"Create a rubric for a text analysis project with report and dashboard."
</div>

**Claude's Suggested Criteria:**

- **Data cleaning & preparation**
- **Analytical depth**
- **Insight clarity**
- **Visual presentation quality**

Her teacher helps finalize the rubric.

    --{{0}}--
This step transforms students from passive recipients to active participants in defining how their work will be evaluated.

---

### üß† Prompt Bank - Step 3

| ‚úÖ High-Competence Prompts | ‚ùå Low-Competence Prompts |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| "Draft a rubric to assess my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize customer reviews." | "Make a rubric that guarantees an A." |
| "What does excellent vs. basic work look like in sentiment analysis projects?" | "Find me a rubric online I can copy." |

> **Reflection Question:** How does co-creating rubrics change the student's relationship with assessment?
>
> [[X]] Increases ownership and understanding
> [[ ]] Makes grading easier for teachers
> [[ ]] Reduces academic standards
> [[ ]] Eliminates the need for feedback

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Working on the Project

Amina uses both AI tools strategically throughout her project:

| Goal | Prompt | Tool |
|------|--------|------|
| Clean data | _"How do I fix missing values in CSV?"_ | ChatGPT |
| Simplify text | _"Rephrase correlation explanation."_ | Claude |
| Create visuals | _"How to present sentiment data?"_ | ChatGPT |
| Write summary | _"Summarize findings in 3 paragraphs."_ | Claude |

    --{{0}}--
Each tool serves different purposes - ChatGPT for technical guidance and brainstorming, Claude for clarity and communication.

---

### üß† Prompt Bank - Step 4

| ‚úÖ High-Competence Prompts | ‚ùå Low-Competence Prompts |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| "What Python functions clean messy text before sentiment analysis?" | "Write the whole code for me." |
| "Which chart types show sentiment trends over time best?" | "What's a flashy graph I can use?" |

    --{{0}}--
High-competence prompts focus on learning and understanding, while low-competence prompts seek complete solutions without learning.

---

## üîç Step 5: Feedback & Reflection

Before submission, Amina seeks AI assistance for improvement:

<div class="prompt-box">
<strong>To Claude:</strong> "Review this paragraph for clarity."<br><br>
<strong>To ChatGPT:</strong> "Give me 3 questions to reflect on my project."
</div>

**Her Reflection Areas:**

- **Surprises in the data**
- **How her analysis evolved**
- **What she'd do differently**

    --{{0}}--
AI becomes a tool for metacognition, helping students think about their thinking and learning process.

---

### üß† Prompt Bank - Step 5

| ‚úÖ High-Competence Prompts | ‚ùå Low-Competence Prompts |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| "Can you help me improve the clarity and tone of this paragraph?" | "Can you make this sound smart?" |
| "Give me critical thinking questions to evaluate my analysis." | "Write a reflection paragraph I can submit." |

> **Interactive Element:** Try crafting your own high-competence reflection prompt!

## üåü Outcome: A Better Assessment Experience

<div class="comparison-table">

| Traditional Approach | AI Co-Designed Approach |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| One-size-fits-all | Personalized |
| Teacher-designed | Student co-designed |
| Static rubric | Adaptable rubric |
| Limited feedback | Continuous AI support |
| End-focused | Process-focused |

</div>

    --{{0}}--
The transformation is comprehensive, affecting every aspect of the assessment experience from design to completion.

## üîß Tools Used

| Tool | Primary Use Cases |
|------|------------------|
| **ChatGPT** | Idea generation, technical support, reflection prompts |
| **Claude** | Rubric creation, text editing, clarity enhancement |

    --{{0}}--
Different AI tools serve different pedagogical purposes, much like different physical tools serve different construction purposes.

---

## üß† Amina's Reflection

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Amina's Key Insight:</strong><br>
"ChatGPT and Claude didn't just help me finish my project ‚Äî they helped me take ownership of it."
</div>

    --{{0}}--
This quote captures the essence of empowering AI use in education - it's about agency and ownership, not dependency.

---
